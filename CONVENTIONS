This document lays out naming and coding conventions for this project.

Naming:
    Classes:
        Class name should be max 2 words, describing the function of the UI
        Class functions: 
            Because we are sharing a namespace with Qt, some functions may collide.
            I still have to find an elegant solution to this.
            However, all functions connected to fields (buttons, inputs, etc) should follow the following template:
            do(name)

    GUI:
        Widgets:
            widget names should follow the following template:
            (widget name)(widget function)
            for example:
            buttonApply or fieldName

Code:
    Duplication:
        If the same piece of code is used in more than 3 places, it should be generalised into a function/method
    
    Grouping:
        Similar GUI functions should be contained in the same file
        if a dialog summons other dialogs, they should also be contained in the same file, unless it is a general dialog (such as the unsaved data warning)
    Arguments:
        Database access should be passed by a db reference only. The subclass should create its own cursor to use.
